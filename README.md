# Dotfiles

Hi to everyone,

This is my personal dotfiles repository which I use to setup my workspace on any new device, a lot faster then manually doing everything over and over again. 
You can find a lot of things here, but I am too lazy to do a big ass `README.md` right now, so I will let AI do it for us a bit later.
Until then enjoy the exploration of all this repo contains! :)

## Setup

Just run the below code into your terminal and everything is set by itself!

If you use `HTTPS` for GIT use this :downarrow:
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3st2k/dotfiles/main/scripts/install.sh)"
```

If you use `SSH` for GIT use this :downarrow:
```
PROTOCOL="SSH" \
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d3st2k/dotfiles/main/scripts/install.sh)"
```
